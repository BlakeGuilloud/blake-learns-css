## Blake learns CSS

"Front end" web development currently pays my bills. I put front end in quotes because I have a CSS guru that cleans up everything I do while I focus on React + Redux and a Node backend.

I absolutely love what I do. I have fallen in love with the simplicity that comes with building React applications; however, I am practically useless when it comes up with creating sleek a sleek, responsive UI.

This project is a challenge to myself to become better at what I have put off learning for so long..


### Objective
Build multiple projects from scratch without utilizing CSS frameworks.

I will be using preprocessors and webpack as a build tool, but the objective is to write as much css as possible.
